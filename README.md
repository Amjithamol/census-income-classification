# Census Income Classification

This project uses machine learning models to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income)
- Contains demographic and employment-related attributes.

## 📌 Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies whether an individual earns more than $50K per year.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling

2. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📈 Results
The model with the best performance was:
- **Model:** Random Forest  
- **Accuracy:** 84.5%  
- **F1-Score:** 82.3%
